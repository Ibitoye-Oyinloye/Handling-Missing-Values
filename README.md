Missing treatments "

The strategy to deal with missing values varies with the problem at hand, the data provided, and other factors too. Some of the common strategies are listed below.
### 	Drop the missing values
### Impute the missing values
## Using central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) of a column 
#### With mean: Missing values are imputed with the mean of the column. Preferred for continuous data with no outliers
#### 	With median: Missing values are imputed with the median of the column. Preferred for continuous data with outliers
#### With mode: Missing values are imputed with the mode of the column. Preferred for categorical data
### 	Using central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) of a column grouped by categories of a categorical column: Preferred for cases where the data under similar categories of a categorical column are likely to have similar properties

## Mean
## Median
## FFill
## Bfill
## Interpolation
